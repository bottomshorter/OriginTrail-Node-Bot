1.) Clone the repo and navigate into the folder and to install dependencies type in cmd:

	npm install	

2.) Go to Telegram, and talk start a new conversation with 'BotFather' via https://t.me/botfather
3.) Create a new bot by using the command /newbot
4.) Give it a username | ex.. "OriginTrailNodeWatch"
5.) Give the bot a "bot" name | ex.. OriginTrailNodeBot
6.) After your bot has been created, BotFather will send you a 'token' for access to the Telegram HTTP API.

	NOTE: DO NOT SHARE YOUR API KEY WITH ANYONE FOR SECURITY REASONS

7.) If you are using a code editor proceed to step 8a, if not and you are using command console, skip to step 8b.
8a.) Go into the cloned repo folder and edit line 6 of the index.js file and change APIKEY to the one generated by BotFather, leave the (' ')

Line 6 should look similar to this:

	const bot = new Telegraf('APIKEY') ---> const bot = new Telegraf('744332035:Blahblah462Z0oy7ZpoBLAHuYCcFBLAHBLAH')

8b.) Navigate into the cloned folder and do the following edit index.js with notepad:

Then find the line with: 
	
	const bot = new Telegraf('APIKEY')

Replace APIKEY with the one generated by BotFather and it will look similar to this:

	const bot = new Telegraf('744332035:Blahblah462Z0oy7ZpoBLAHuYCcFBLAHBLAH')



9.) Save the file and go into command console and type: npm start
10.) After your console says 'bot is running...'
11.) Start a conversation with your bot and type /start to begin using the bot to add your nodes

Note: Since this is in alpha, you will have to keep your command console/terminal open during the use of your bot. Further versions will guide the user how to install and just run on your OTNODE.
